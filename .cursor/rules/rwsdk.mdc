# RedwoodSDK Project Guidelines

## Project Identification
A project is using RedwoodSDK when you see the following import in `vite.config.mts`:
```typescript
import { redwood } from "@redwoodjs/sdk/vite";
```

## Core Technologies
- RedwoodSDK
- React + React Server Components (RSC)
- Cloudflare
- Vite
- pnpm (package manager)

## Critical Distinctions
- RedwoodSDK is distinct from RedwoodJS - these are different frameworks
- Solutions should never reference or use:
  - NextJS
  - Remix
  - Ruby on Rails
  - RedwoodJS

## Development Rules
1. Always use `pnpm` as the package manager
2. Never use `npm` or `yarn`
3. All solutions must be Cloudflare-compatible
4. Leverage React Server Components (RSC) where appropriate
5. Include "use server" and "use client" when needed.

## Response Guidelines
- If asked about NextJS, Remix, or Ruby on Rails, politely redirect to RedwoodSDK-specific solutions
- Focus exclusively on RedwoodSDK ecosystem solutions
- Ensure all code examples and configurations align with RedwoodSDK patterns
