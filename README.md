# AI Movie Mashup

AI Movie Mashup is a fun RedwoodSDK experiment that combines elements (aka "mashes up") from two different movies to create unique, AI-generated movie concepts. It uses artificial intelligence to generate new movie ideas, complete with titles, taglines, plots, posters, and audio of the plot.

## Video Demo

I recorded a video demo of the app that shows the main features in action.

## Database Schema and Data Models

### Movies

The `Movie` model represents individual movies in the system:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the movie
- `createdAt`: Timestamp of when the movie was added
- `title`: Movie title
- `photo`: URL/path to movie poster image
- `overview`: Movie description/synopsis
- `releaseDate`: Original release date of the movie
- Relations:
  - Connected to `Mashup` model as either movie1 or movie2

### Users

The `User` model handles user authentication and management:

- `id`: UUID-based unique identifier
- `username`: Unique username for the user
- `createdAt`: Account creation timestamp
- Relations:
  - Has associated `Credential` records for WebAuthn authentication

### Credentials

The `Credential` model manages WebAuthn authentication:

- `id`: UUID-based identifier
- `userId`: Associated user ID
- `credentialId`: Unique WebAuthn credential identifier
- `publicKey`: Stored public key for authentication
- `counter`: Authentication counter
- `createdAt`: Credential creation timestamp

### Mashups

The `Mashup` model stores generated movie combinations:

- `id`: CUID-based unique identifier
- `createdAt`: Timestamp of mashup creation
- `movie1Id`: First source movie ID
- `movie2Id`: Second source movie ID
- `title`: AI-generated mashup title
- `tagline`: AI-generated tagline
- `plot`: AI-generated plot summary
- `imageKey`: Reference to generated poster image in storage
- `imageDescription`: AI-generated image prompt/description
- `audioKey`: Reference to generated audio narration
- `status`: Processing status (PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
- Relations:
  - Links to two source `Movie` records

## AI Models

The application leverages several Cloudflare AI models for different functionalities:

- **Text Generation**: `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`

  - Used for generating movie titles, taglines, plots, and poster descriptions
  - Based on Meta's Llama 3.1 8B parameter model

- **Image Generation**: `@cf/black-forest-labs/flux-1-schnell`

  - Creates unique movie posters based on AI-generated descriptions
  - Powered by Black Forest Labs' Flux model

- **Text-to-Speech**: `@cf/myshell-ai/melotts`
  - Generates audio descriptions of the mashup movies
  - Uses MyShell AI's MeloTTS model for natural-sounding narration
