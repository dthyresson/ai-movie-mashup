# AI Movie Mashup

> Griffin: So it's a psychic, political, thriller comedy with a heart.

> Writer: With a heart, not unlike Ghost meets Manchurian Candidate.

**From ["The Player"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Player_(1992*film)s>) - a 1992 American satirical black comedy mystery film directed by Robert Altman and written by Michael Tolkin.\***

AI Movie Mashup is a fun RedwoodSDK experiment that combines elements (aka "mashes up") from two different movies to create unique, AI-generated movie concepts. It uses artificial intelligence to generate new movie ideas, complete with titles, taglines, plots, posters, and audio of the plot.

## Important !!!

This app is not deployed. It's a work in progress.

You should run locally with `pnpm dev` and check it out.

I would not deploy until I can ensure rate limiting is in place to prevent abuse and runaway AI charges.

The `api` is open currently and thus accessible to all and open to potential high AI costs.

If you choose to deploy, your do so knowing that you are responsible for the cost of the AI usage.

## Database Schema and Data Models

### Movies

The `Movie` model represents individual movies in the system:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the movie
- `createdAt`: Timestamp of when the movie was added
- `title`: Movie title
- `photo`: URL/path to movie poster image
- `overview`: Movie description/synopsis
- `releaseDate`: Original release date of the movie
- Relations:
  - Connected to `Mashup` model as either movie1 or movie2

### Users

The `User` model handles user authentication and management:

- `id`: UUID-based unique identifier
- `username`: Unique username for the user
- `createdAt`: Account creation timestamp
- Relations:
  - Has associated `Credential` records for WebAuthn authentication

### Credentials

The `Credential` model manages WebAuthn authentication:

- `id`: UUID-based identifier
- `userId`: Associated user ID
- `credentialId`: Unique WebAuthn credential identifier
- `publicKey`: Stored public key for authentication
- `counter`: Authentication counter
- `createdAt`: Credential creation timestamp

### Mashups

The `Mashup` model stores generated movie combinations:

- `id`: CUID-based unique identifier
- `createdAt`: Timestamp of mashup creation
- `movie1Id`: First source movie ID
- `movie2Id`: Second source movie ID
- `title`: AI-generated mashup title
- `tagline`: AI-generated tagline
- `plot`: AI-generated plot summary
- `imageKey`: Reference to generated poster image in storage
- `imageDescription`: AI-generated image prompt/description
- `audioKey`: Reference to generated audio narration
- `status`: Processing status (PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
- Relations:
  - Links to two source `Movie` records

## AI Models

The application leverages several Cloudflare AI models for different functionalities:

- **Text Generation**: `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`

  - Used for generating movie titles, taglines, plots, and poster descriptions
  - Based on Meta's Llama 3.1 8B parameter model

- **Image Generation**: `@cf/black-forest-labs/flux-1-schnell`

  - Creates unique movie posters based on AI-generated descriptions
  - Powered by Black Forest Labs' Flux model

- **Text-to-Speech**: `@cf/myshell-ai/melotts`
  - Generates audio descriptions of the mashup movies
  - Uses MyShell AI's MeloTTS model for natural-sounding narration

## AI Agents

The application uses an agent-based architecture to handle the movie mashup generation process. The main agent, `MashupAgent`, orchestrates the entire workflow using WebSocket connections for real-time communication.

### MashupAgent

The `MashupAgent` is a stateful agent that:

- Maintains WebSocket connections with clients
- Processes movie selection requests
- Coordinates the generation of mashup content
- Handles error cases and connection lifecycle
- Manages the streaming of generated content back to clients

### Agent UI Components

The agent interface consists of several React components:

- **MovieSelector**: Allows users to choose two movies for the mashup
- **GenerateButton**: Triggers the mashup generation process
- **MashupResults**: Displays the generated content including:
  - Title
  - Tagline
  - Plot
  - Generated poster image
  - Audio narration
- **DebugMessages**: Optional component for monitoring WebSocket communication

### Real-time Updates

The agent system provides real-time updates as content is generated:

- Streaming text updates for title, tagline, and plot
- Progressive image generation
- Audio file generation
- Error handling and status updates

### WebSocket Communication

The agent uses WebSocket connections to:

- Maintain persistent connections with clients
- Stream generated content in real-time
- Handle connection errors and cleanup
- Manage the generation workflow state

## Agent Routing

The agent is routed via the `/agents/*` route.

This is a Cloudflare specific routing mechanism that automatically routes HTTP requests and/or WebSocket connections to `/agents/:agent/:name`.

It allows you to connect React apps directly to Agents using the `useAgent` hook for websockets updates.

```ts
route("/*", async ({ request }: RequestInfo) => {
    // Automatically routes HTTP requests and/or WebSocket connections to /agents/:agent/:name
    // Best for: connecting React apps directly to Agents using useAgent from agents/react
    // The MashupAgent is defined in the MashupAgent.ts file
    // Wrangler durable_objects config defines the agent name as MASHUP_AGENT and the class name as MashupAgent
    // So /agents/mashup-agent/default will route to the MashupAgent when an agent client
    // uses the `useAgent` hook for websockets updates

    return (
      (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ||
      Response.json({ msg: "no agent here" }, { status: 404 })
    );
  }),
```
