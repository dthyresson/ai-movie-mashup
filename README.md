# AI Movie Mashup

> Griffin: So it's a psychic, political, thriller comedy with a heart.

> Writer: With a heart, not unlike Ghost meets Manchurian Candidate.

**From ["The Player"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Player_(1992*film)s>) - a 1992 American satirical black comedy mystery film directed by Robert Altman and written by Michael Tolkin.\***

-- Old demo. a little out of date. new one coming soon with the agent streaming.

## Important !!!

This app is not deployed. It's a work in progress.

You should run locally with `pnpm dev` and check it out.

I would not deploy until I can ensure rate limiting is in place to prevent abuse and runaway AI charges.

The `api` is open currently and thus accessible to all and open so you will want to use the [AI Gateway ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) to both cache and limit the usage.

If you choose to deploy, your do so knowing that you are responsible for the cost of the AI usage.

## AI Models

The application leverages several Cloudflare AI models for different functionalities:

- **Text Generation**: `@cf/meta/llama-3.2-3b-instruct`

  - Used for generating movie titles, taglines, plots, and poster descriptions
  - Based on Meta's Llama 3.1 8B parameter model
  - Utilizes the `streamAndReturnCompleteText` helper function from `helpers.ts` for real-time streaming

- **Image Generation**: `@cf/black-forest-labs/flux-1-schnell`

  - Creates unique movie posters based on AI-generated descriptions
  - Powered by Black Forest Labs' Flux model
  - Uses `base64ToBlob` helper function from `helpers.ts` for image data conversion

- **Text-to-Speech**: `@cf/myshell-ai/melotts`
  - Generates audio descriptions of the mashup movies
  - Uses MyShell AI's MeloTTS model for natural-sounding narration

### Helper Functions

The application uses several key helper functions from `helpers.ts`:

- `streamAndReturnCompleteText`: Handles real-time streaming of AI-generated text content

  - Manages WebSocket connections
  - Streams text chunks to clients
  - Returns complete generated text
  - Used for title, tagline, plot, and poster description generation

- `base64ToBlob`: Converts base64-encoded image data to binary blobs
  - Used for processing AI-generated images
  - Handles image data conversion for storage in R2

## AI Agents

The application uses a single `MashupAgent` to handle the entire movie mashup generation process. The agent maintains WebSocket connections with clients and orchestrates the generation of content in real-time.

### MashupAgent

The `MashupAgent` is a stateful agent that:

- Maintains WebSocket connections with clients
- Processes movie selection requests
- Coordinates the generation of mashup content in sequence:
  1. Title generation
  2. Tagline generation
  3. Plot generation
  4. Media generation (poster and audio)
- Handles error cases and connection lifecycle
- Manages the streaming of generated content back to clients

### Mashup Creator UI Components

The mashup creator interface consists of several React components:

- **MovieSelector**: Allows users to choose two movies for the mashup
- **GenerateButton**: Triggers the mashup generation process
- **MashupResults**: Displays the generated content including:
  - Title
  - Tagline
  - Plot
  - Generated poster image
  - Audio narration
- **DebugMessages**: Optional component for monitoring WebSocket communication

### Real-time Updates with useAgent

The Mashup Creator UI leverages the Cloudflare Agents SDK's `useAgent` hook to establish and maintain a WebSocket connection with the `MashupAgent`. This hook is crucial for:

1. **Connection Management**:

   - Automatically establishes a WebSocket connection to `/agents/mashup-agent/default`
   - Handles connection lifecycle (open, close, error)
   - Manages reconnection logic

2. **Real-time State Updates**:

   - Receives streaming updates for generated content:
     - Title chunks as they're generated
     - Tagline chunks as they're generated
     - Plot chunks as they're generated
     - Image and audio URLs when complete
   - Updates UI state in real-time using React state management

3. **Message Handling**:

   - Processes incoming WebSocket messages
   - Parses JSON data
   - Updates appropriate state variables based on message type
   - Handles error cases and connection issues

4. **Content Generation**:
   - Sends movie selection to the agent
   - Triggers the mashup generation process
   - Manages the generation state (loading, error, complete)

Example usage in the MashupCreator component:

```tsx
const agent = useAgent({
  agent: "mashup-agent",
  onMessage: (message) => {
    // Handle streaming updates
    if (data.title) updateStreamingState(setTitle, data.title);
    if (data.tagline) updateStreamingState(setTagline, data.tagline);
    if (data.plot) updateStreamingState(setPlot, data.plot);
    // ... handle other content types
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    // Handle connection errors
    setError("Connection error. Please try again.");
  },
  onClose: () => {
    // Handle connection closure
    setIsGenerating(false);
  },
});
```

The `useAgent` hook provides a seamless way to integrate real-time, streaming content generation into the React UI, making the mashup creation process feel immediate and interactive.

## Agent Routing

The agent is routed via the `/agents/*` route, which automatically routes WebSocket connections to the appropriate agent instance. The routing is handled by the RedwoodSDK's agent routing system.

```ts
route("/*", async ({ request }: RequestInfo) => {
    return (
      (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ||
      Response.json({ msg: "no agent here" }, { status: 404 })
    );
  }),
```

## Add New Movies

To add new movies to the system:

1. **Source Movies from TMDB**:

   - All movie data comes from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org)
   - Each movie has a unique TMDB ID (e.g., "11-star-wars", "12-finding-nemo")

2. **Add to Movies Array**:
   In `src/scripts/movies.ts`, add a new movie object with the following structure:

   ```typescript
   {
     id: "tmdb-id",  // The TMDB ID
     title: "Movie Title",
     photo: "/path-to-poster.jpg",  // TMDB poster path
     overview: "Movie description/synopsis",
     releaseDate: "YYYY-MM-DD"  // Optional release date
   }
   ```

3. **Example**:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: "12345-movie-name",
     title: "New Movie",
     photo: "/new-poster.jpg",
     overview: "A new movie description...",
     releaseDate: "2024-01-01"
   }
   ```

## Add New Presets

To create new movie mashup presets:

1. **Create Preset Combinations**:
   In `src/scripts/presets.ts`, add a new preset object with the following structure:

   ```typescript
   {
     movie1Id: "tmdb-id-1",  // First movie's TMDB ID
     movie2Id: "tmdb-id-2",  // Second movie's TMDB ID
     isFavorite: false  // Optional: mark as favorite
   }
   ```

2. **Example**:
   ```typescript
   {
     movie1Id: "12345-movie-name",
     movie2Id: "67890-another-movie",
     isFavorite: true
   }
   ```

### Seeding the Database

After adding new movies and presets:

1. **Run the Seed Script**:
   ```bash
   pnpm seed
   ```

The `seed.ts` script will:

- Clear existing data
- Create a test user
- Add all movies from `movies.ts`
- Create presets from `presets.ts`

### Important Notes

1. **TMDB IDs**:

   - Always use the TMDB ID format (e.g., "12345-movie-name")
   - These IDs are used to fetch movie details and posters
   - Ensure the IDs exist in TMDB's database

2. **Preset Combinations**:

   - Both `movie1Id` and `movie2Id` must reference valid movie IDs
   - The combination of `movie1Id` and `movie2Id` must be unique
   - You can mark interesting combinations as favorites with `isFavorite: true`

3. **Data Validation**:
   - The seed script will validate the data
   - It ensures all referenced movies exist
   - It maintains data integrity in the database
